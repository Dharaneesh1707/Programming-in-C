Arithmetic operators are ==symbols used in programming and mathematics to perform calculations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and more, working on numerical values (operands) to produce a numerical result, also encompassing modulus (%), exponentiation (**), and unary operators (like negation)==. They are fundamental for data manipulation, enabling basic math within code and applications.
