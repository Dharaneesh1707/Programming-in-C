A **data type** is ==an attribute of a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value and what operations can be performed on it==. Data types are fundamental to programming and data analysis, ensuring data is stored and processed correctly. 

Data types can be broadly categorized into several groups:

In Programming

Programming languages use data types to define the kind of values a variable can hold. 

Primitive (Built-in) Data Types 

These are the most basic types supported directly by a programming language. Common examples include: 

- **Integer (`int`)**: Represents whole numbers without fractions (e.g., 10, -5, 1000).
- **Floating-Point (`float`, `double`)**: Represents numbers with fractional parts (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
- **Boolean (`bool`)**: Represents logical values, typically `true` or `false`.
- **Character (`char`)**: Represents a single letter, digit, or symbol (e.g., 'A', '!', '7').
- **String (`string`)**: A sequence of characters used for text (e.g., "Hello world"). 

Non-Primitive (Composite or User-Defined) Data Types 

These types are derived from primitive types or group multiple values together. Common examples include: 

- **Arrays**: A collection of items, typically of the same type, stored in a specific order.
- **Objects/Structs/Records**: Complex data structures that contain multiple data fields, often of different types, indexed by names.
- **Pointers**: A data type whose value refers to the memory address of another value. 

In Statistics/Data Analysis

In statistics, data is classified based on its nature and the level of measurement possible. 

- **Qualitative (Categorical) Data**: Represents categories or labels and cannot be measured numerically.
    - **Nominal**: Data without any specific order (e.g., hair color, gender, nationality).
    - **Ordinal**: Data with a natural order or ranking, but the difference between values may not be meaningful (e.g., customer satisfaction ratings, letter grades).
- **Quantitative (Numerical) Data**: Represents numerical values that can be measured and used in mathematical operations.
    - **Discrete**: Data that can only take specific, separate values (typically whole numbers), such as the number of students in a class.
    - **Continuous**: Data that can take any value within a given range, such as height, weight, or temperature. 

Understanding data types is essential for efficient coding, data handling, and applying the correct analytical methods.
